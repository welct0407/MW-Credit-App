-- R086 (owner approval, 21 October 2026): Loan Close counted only receipt-linked repayments.
-- loan_close_calculation_v83 filtered repayments with r."Ref Payment" IS DISTINCT FROM p_exclude_payment. For an ordinary
-- payoff p_exclude_payment is NULL, and NULL IS DISTINCT FROM NULL is false, so every repayment without a "Ref Payment"
-- (the legacy rows of 5 August to 18 September 2026) was dropped: the charges they paid looked unpaid again and the
-- outstanding principal looked higher, so the quoted payoff was too high. Each of the four filters now reads
-- (p_exclude_payment IS NULL OR "Ref Payment" IS DISTINCT FROM p_exclude_payment): with no exclusion every repayment
-- counts; with an exclusion (a closing receipt being corrected) only that receipt's repayments are left out, as before.
-- The function is replaced in place: same signature, result shape and plan-hash context, LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE, invoker
-- rights, pinned search_path, owner and ACL. The (text,date) wrapper, apply_loan_close_calculation_v83, prepare_loan_close
-- and pwa_apply_loan_close_v2 call it and need no change; no other routine filters on a nullable exclusion this way
-- (payment correction excludes a non-null payment id). No table, column, data or trigger change.
