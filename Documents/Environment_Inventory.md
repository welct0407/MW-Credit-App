# Current environment inventory

Updated 14 October 2026 from existing deployment evidence. This document lists current bindings and latest verified state, not a fresh live audit.

Google project: `clever-oasis-508610-n7` (737787224638), region `asia-southeast1`. Shared Cloud SQL: `appsheet-pg-prod-20260914`, public host `34.21.174.215:5432`. Preserve that resource name. Verify the complete project/instance/database tuple for any operation.

Private receipts: `gs://mw-payment-receipts-prod-508610-n7`. Agent originals and manual uploads retain their existing validated paths. Public access is not enabled. AppSheet connection records are removed; current service identities own access. Do not restore old store keys.

## Latest verified deployments

Native schedules: notifications every minute for recovery; daily charges 00:05; recent analytics hourly. Immediate push is post-commit. Existing agent timers/cutoffs/routes are governed by MW-Integration-Agent's service catalogue.

The separate `mw_agent` database holds integration journals/audit state. Metabase remains on Railway, using governed PostgreSQL reporting sources and its own application database. The Debian-hosted borrower chart remains separately owned.

## Infrastructure and credentials

Terraform owns the adopted GCP/Grafana/Debian/DNS/Azure VM-01/network/backup, Cloudflare tunnel and Tailscale metadata within the completion matrix. Shared SQL contents, receipt objects and the Azure VM controller are outside that adoption. Preserve remote-state and resource deletion guards.

Dedicated VM-01 UAMI and Azure-to-GCP federation provide unattended administration; existing SystemAssigned identity/controller remain unchanged. Use the matrix and owning infrastructure runbooks for exact references. Credentials belong in Secret Manager; never copy values into this inventory.

## Retirement and remaining follow-ups

AppSheet's four retained cloud definitions are paused, all24 bots and API/key access disabled, account/team Sources and Integration Stores empty, weekly updates off. Seventy-three AppSheet-only SQL network entries were removed; the workstation/native routes remain. No AppSheet editor checks or reactivation are part of PWA delivery.

License revocation remains owner-controlled and unconfirmed. Lisa's post-V91 enrollment retry remains pending in its evidence. Paused credential migration remains unfinished. Temporary SSH cleanup was blocked by automatic review; its expiry and exact limitation remain in the retirement record. These facts are not claims of new tests.

Use [release tracker](Release_Tracker.md) for current release status; do not append old release checkpoints here.
