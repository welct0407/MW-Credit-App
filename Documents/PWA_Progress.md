# MW Credit implementation progress

**Last updated:** 8 October 2026 (Asia/Bangkok)

**Current position:** R052 is Open. Typeahead search is deployed. A reported missing-record case exposed the initial false-only visibility filter; the approved API-only correction includes blank flags while keeping explicitly hidden borrowers excluded. Focused checks and CI passed; the API correction is deployed and private read-only eligibility confirmation passed. Final unsigned checks passed. No borrower data, permissions or Hosting changed. Full Phase1/2 completion is not claimed.

## Completed and available

| Capability | Current result |
| --- | --- |
| Development foundation | Infrastructure, delivery tooling and shared database ownership established for the recorded scope |
| Initial navigation and read/access prototypes | Checkpoints 1A and 1B accepted by the owner |
| Canonical DEV domain | HTTPS active; owner confirmed sign-in, Borrowers/Collection reads and refresh persistence |
| Borrower name search | Server-side Thai/English search and query-bound paging implemented/tested/deployed; owner review pending |
| PWA foundation | Install/update controls, public-only offline fallback and themed mobile navigation tested and deployed; owner confirmed iPhone Safari home-screen installation; offline/update review pending |
| Owner-only Google sign-in and borrower reads | Checkpoint 2A tested, deployed and owner-validated; actual owner identity pinned |
| Related loan list/detail and presentation refinements | Implemented, tested and deployed; neutral surfaces, grouping, readable labels and wider desktop details await final owner visual acceptance |
| Collection board, charge detail and Upcoming Charges | Tested/deployed with full-width compact header, expandable navigation and bounded first-page Upcoming previews. Owner visual/perceived-speed review pending |
| Sign-in survives refresh | Implemented, tested and deployed; owner confirmed real sign-in persists after refresh. Browser reopening and cross-tab logout were tested with the actual SDK and synthetic identities, not the owner's live session |

Business records are fetched afresh and kept in memory. Offline records/drafts, payments and full loan management are not delivered by this read-only checkpoint.

## Overall roadmap

| Phase | Outcome | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Development infrastructure and database ownership | Complete for recorded scope |
| 1 | Full feature coverage, contracts and acceptance criteria | In progress; initial checkpoints accepted, full parity inventory still open |
| 2 | Secure application foundation and first read flows | In progress; 2A complete, 2B/2C deployed, domain 2D owner-validated; 2E deployed for review |
| 3 | Production infrastructure and delivery readiness | Not started |
| 4 | First complete financial workflow in DEV | Not started |
| 5 | Complete mobile/desktop OLTP, including full loan management | Not started |
| 6 | Complete desktop OLAP management | Not started |
| 7 | Metabase integration/reporting enhancements | Deferred until after production go-live; not a launch prerequisite |
| 8 | Automation, notifications and coexistence | Not started |
| 9 | Complete launch verification and operational recovery | Not started |
| 10 | Contained production deployment | Not started; requires scoped production authorization |
| 11 | Parallel production pilot | Not started |
| 12 | Close readiness gaps and prepare cutover decision | Not started; actual cutover remains the owner's decision |

Launch order: **1 → 2 → 3/4 → 5 → 6 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12**. Phase 7 is a separate post-go-live workstream. No overall completion percentage is assigned because full feature/parity coverage is still being established.

## Review needed and what comes next
**Domain and scrolling status, 8 October 2026:** dev-lm.mw-credit.com is active and owner-validated for sign-in, Borrowers/Collection reads and refresh persistence. Fixed header and independent desktop scrolling are implemented/tested; retain the recorded limits of physical-device and browser acceptance. [Scope](PWA_Implementation_Plan.md#phase-2-secure-application-foundation).

- **Owner acceptance:** compact mobile header and mobile/desktop navigation accepted on 8 October ("looks good. carry on"). This does not establish full Phase2 or broader financial/performance acceptance.
- **Next checkpoint:** refresh Borrowers from the first page and confirm the previously missing record is available. This API-only fix needs no frontend Update/reload. Native iPhone/typeahead and offline/update acceptance remain separately scoped.
- **Remaining planning work:** close Phase 1 feature/parity and acceptance gaps alongside agreed slices. Production readiness and financial workflows follow the roadmap dependencies, not completion of this UI review alone.
- **Current blockers:** no technical delivery blocker remains; regression, exact-source CI, private read-only eligibility and unsigned boundary checks passed. Owner visibility recheck and full Phase2 acceptance remain open.
