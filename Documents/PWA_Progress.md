# MW Credit implementation progress

**Last updated:** 7 October 2026 (Asia/Bangkok)

**Current position:** R052 is Open. The owner authorized continuation to bounded checkpoint 2C within Phase 2; exact Collection read semantics are being designed. The DEV application can read borrowers and related loans; it cannot yet perform financial transactions. AppSheet continues operating in parallel.

[Open DEV app](https://mw-credit-app-dev-737787224638.web.app) · [Detailed roadmap](PWA_Implementation_Plan.md) · [Checkpoint evidence](../outputs/r052-pwa/README.md)

## Completed and available

| Capability | Current result |
| --- | --- |
| Development foundation | Infrastructure, delivery tooling and shared database ownership established for the recorded scope |
| Initial navigation and read/access prototypes | Checkpoints 1A and 1B accepted by the owner |
| Owner-only Google sign-in and borrower reads | Checkpoint 2A tested, deployed and owner-validated; actual owner identity pinned |
| Related loan list/detail and presentation refinements | Implemented, tested and deployed; neutral surfaces, grouping, readable labels and wider desktop details await final owner visual acceptance |
| Sign-in survives refresh | Implemented, tested and deployed; owner confirmed real sign-in persists after refresh. Browser reopening and cross-tab logout were tested with the actual SDK and synthetic identities, not the owner's live session |

Business records are fetched afresh and kept in memory. Offline records/drafts, payments and full loan management are not delivered by this read-only checkpoint.

## Overall roadmap

| Phase | Outcome | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Development infrastructure and database ownership | Complete for recorded scope |
| 1 | Full feature coverage, contracts and acceptance criteria | In progress; initial checkpoints accepted, full parity inventory still open |
| 2 | Secure application foundation and first read flows | In progress; 2A complete, 2B deployed, 2C design authorized; separate neutral visual acceptance not recorded |
| 3 | Production infrastructure and delivery readiness | Not started |
| 4 | First complete financial workflow in DEV | Not started |
| 5 | Complete mobile/desktop OLTP, including full loan management | Not started |
| 6 | Complete desktop OLAP management | Not started |
| 7 | Metabase integration/reporting enhancements | Deferred until after production go-live; not a launch prerequisite |
| 8 | Automation, notifications and coexistence | Not started |
| 9 | Complete launch verification and operational recovery | Not started |
| 10 | Contained production deployment | Not started; requires scoped production authorization |
| 11 | Parallel production pilot | Not started |
| 12 | Close readiness gaps and prepare cutover decision | Not started; actual cutover remains the owner's decision |

Launch order: **1 → 2 → 3/4 → 5 → 6 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12**. Phase 7 is a separate post-go-live workstream. No overall completion percentage is assigned because full feature/parity coverage is still being established.

## Review needed and what comes next

- **Owner review now:** confirm the current neutral styling, group headers, desktop pane balance and related-loan navigation. Refresh persistence is already owner-confirmed; that does not accept the whole phase.
- **Authorized next checkpoint:** the owner said “ok, continue.” Agent A is defining checkpoint 2C Collection read semantics. Reconcile exact eligibility/status formulas and source/permission boundaries before implementation; grants and deployment wait for reviewed contract and tests. Stop at the next bounded owner checkpoint.
- **Remaining planning work:** close Phase 1 feature/parity and acceptance gaps alongside agreed slices. Production readiness and financial workflows follow the roadmap dependencies, not completion of this UI review alone.
- **Current blockers:** no unresolved implementation failure reported for the delivered persistence follow-up. The exact 2C contract is pending design review; no new grant or deployment has occurred. Continuation does not imply explicit acceptance of every prior visual detail.
